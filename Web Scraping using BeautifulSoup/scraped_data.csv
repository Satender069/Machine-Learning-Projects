0,"US Covid-19 deaths cross 600,000, full vaccination at 40% so far"," Six hundred thousand. Americas coronavirus death toll topped the 600,000 mark Tuesday, even as an aggressive nationwide vaccination drive has crushed daily caseloads and pulled the country back to a place where it can look forward to summer as usual and even Independence Day celebrations in pre-pandemic style. Hundreds continue to die each day. President Joe Biden is warning that the fight isn't over and is urging more Americans to get vaccinated as contagious variants spread. It's been 16 months since the first known deaths from the virus in the US. Within four months starting early March last year, 100,000 perished. Fall and winter were brutal, taking the toll to 400,000 before Biden took charge as president. The last 200,000 deaths have come at a much slower pace, riding on strong vaccination numbers. By now, more than 50 per cent of Americans have got at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine and over 40 per cent are fully vaccinated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Crowds are surging at tourist hotspots, businesses are reopening with a burst of confidence, the malls are packed, people are shaking hands again. Restrictions being eased States like California and New York which bore the worst brunt of the initial outbreak are lifting most restrictions this week, and some of them are marking the moment with fireworks. Biden&nbsp;was hoping to get at least 70 per cent of the population partially vaccinated by July 4 and the current numbers are just short of 65 percent. The US is currently delivering 1 million jabs per day, dropping off the highs and the urgency of 3 million plus vaccines per day in early Spring. In New York, 70 per cent of adults in the state have received at least one shot. ""What does 70 per cent mean? It means that we can now return to life as we know it,"" Governor Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. The White House is planning a big bang July Fourth celebration to mark a standout moment in the country's recovery, even as other nations continue to struggle with lockdowns and resurgent variants of the virus. Biden plans to celebrate the July Fourth holiday as America's ""summer of freedom"" and highlight his government's ""wartime response"" to the&nbsp;vaccination challenge when he took office. "
1,Covid vaccination in India without online registration: How to get coronavirus jab onsite?," Amid the slowing down of the Covid second wave in India, medical experts strongly believe that the country may soon face a third wave outbreak of the pandemic. According to medical experts, mass vaccination is the only solution to combat a potential third wave, and until now, the vaccination rollout in the country was carried out via an online registration system. And now, to accelerate the ongoing vaccination rollout program, the government has made it clear that online registration is not mandatory to receive Covaxin or Covishield vaccines.&nbsp; Covid vaccines without registration According to the latest updates, more than 26 crore people have been vaccinated in India, and it is almost 17 percent of the total population in the country. However, the pace of the vaccination rollout in the country should be ramped up to combat a potential third wave effectively. From now, prior booking of vaccination is not mandatory to avail coronavirus jabs.&nbsp; The government believes that this new step could boost the vaccination drive, especially in the rural areas where smartphone and internet penetration is low.&nbsp; As per the new guideline, registering in the CoWIN app is not mandatory to receive the coronavirus vaccine. Instead, anyone aged 18 or more can directly visit the nearest Covid vaccination center, and the vaccinator will perform the onsite registration.&nbsp; Government ramping up vaccination drive in India After reaching India, the vaccinator will collect the details of the person who has walked in and will do an onsite registration to maintain the coronavirus&nbsp;vaccination database.&nbsp; ""Anyone, aged 18 years or more, can directly go to the nearest vaccination Center where the vaccinator performs the on-site registration and provides vaccination in the same visit. This is also popularly known as ""walk-ins,"" said the health ministry in a recent statement.&nbsp; In the meantime, on June 15, India witnessed&nbsp;63,868 fresh Covid&nbsp;cases and 1,459 fatalities. The data indicates that the second wave in India has waned, and the trend will continue in the coming days as well.&nbsp; "
2,Covid origin mystery: Live bats locked up in cages at Wuhan Institute of Virology sparks debate," It was in late 2019 that the first case of the SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in Wuhan, China. At that time no medical experts foresaw the killing capability of this virus. Pulling the entire world to sleep mode, the virus soon spread like wildfire, and emerged as a global pandemic. Ever since the day of the virus outbreak, several medical experts suggested that Covid could have been escaped from the Wuhan laboratory. Recently, United States president Joe Biden also ordered a full-fledged investigation to unveil the mystery surrounding the origin of the pandemic. Amid speculations regarding the lab leak origin of coronavirus, a new video from the Wihan Institute of Virology has made many people believe that Covid could be manmade.&nbsp; Live bats locked up in cages at Wuhan Institute of Virology The footage which has now gone viral on online spaces shows live bats locked up in cages at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. The clip has also triggered a fresh wave of controversy, and people have started claiming that the Covid pandemic might have escaped from the laboratory, either intentionally or accidentally.&nbsp; Is WHO trying to cover up a global conspiracy for China's gains?&nbsp; As people started doubting China's role in the pandemic outbreak, the WHO had launched an investigation to find the exact origin of the&nbsp;Covid&nbsp;pandemic. However, the final report from the apex health body claimed that the chance of a laboratory leak is extremely unlikely.&nbsp; Dr Peter Daszak, a zoologist who was a WHO team member also claimed that the lab leak speculation is nothing but a conspiracy theory.&nbsp; ""No BATS were sent to Wuhan lab for genetic analysis of viruses collected in the field. That's now how this science works. We collect bat samples, send them to the lab. We RELEASE bats where we catch them!&nbsp;This is a widely circulated conspiracy theory. This piece describes work I'm the lead on and labs I've collaborated with for 15 years. They DO NOT have live or dead bats in them. There is no evidence anywhere that this happened. It's an error I hope will be corrected,"" said Daszak.&nbsp; However, Daszak changed his previous statement later and revealed that the WHO team had not asked the institute whether they house bats.&nbsp; A few months back, Chinese virologist Dr Le-Meng Yan claimed that the coronavirus&nbsp;pandemic was intentionally released by China as a bioweapon.&nbsp;Yan also made it clear that China has been repeatedly denying the allegations and is using misinformation to mislead the world.

3,"New imaging technique could help pilots, drivers in foggy weather conditions"," The researchers at Shiv Nadar University in Gautam Buddha Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, showed the methodology by conducting extensive trials on foggy winter mornings. They chose 10 red LED lights as the light source. The light source was then varied by altering the current flowing through the LEDs at a rate of around 15 cycles per second. The researchers kept a camera 150 meters away from the LEDs. The image was recorded by the camera and transferred to a desktop computer. The characteristics of the source were then extracted using computer methods and knowledge of the modulation frequency. This is known as 'demodulation.' To obtain a clear image, the image has to be demodulated at a rate equal to the rate of modulation of the light source. Using the modulation-demodulation process, the researchers witnessed a significant improvement in image quality. The length of time it takes the computer to complete the procedure is determined by the size of the image. ""The computational time for a 2160 × 2160 image is about 20 milliseconds,"" says Bapan Debnath, PhD scholar at RRI and co-author of the paper. That's about the size of the image with the LEDs. In 2016, his colleagues estimated the rate. The researchers&nbsp;repeated the experiment several times, noting the progress each time. When the fog intensity fluctuated during the observation, they did not see a significant improvement in image quality. There was a high breeze in this case, and they noticed fog trails throughout the area. The density of water droplets in the air changed with time, making the modulation-demodulation process less efficient. The researchers then altered the experimental design. They created an external substance, a piece of cardboard held 20 cm away from the LEDs, to reflect the light to the camera. The cardboard was 75 meters away from the camera. The camera captured the modulated light reflected from the cardboard as it traveled through the fog. They demonstrated how their methodology still considerably enhanced the image quality. When they repeated the experiment in bright sunlight, they discovered that after demodulating the source, the image quality was good enough to discern the LEDs from the brightly reflected sunlight. How the discovery helps? The team's research has provided a way for boosting image quality without the use of significant computations. The team from the Raman Research Institute (RRI), Bengaluru, an autonomous institute of the Department of Science and Technology; Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation, Ahmedabad; Shiv Nadar University, Gautam Buddha Nagar; and Université Rennes and Université Paris-Saclay, CNRS, France, modulated and demodulated the light source at the observer's end to achieve sharpness. The findings were published in the journal 'OSA Continuum.' The technology is inexpensive, requiring only a few LEDs and a standard desktop computer capable of executing the process in less than a second. The technology can improve airplane-landing tactics by providing the pilot with a clear view of beacons on the runway, which is far superior to relying just on reflected radio waves, as is now the case. In rail, marine, and road transportation, the technique can help uncover obstructions in the path that would otherwise be concealed by fog, as well as aid in the detection of lighthouse beacons. More research is needed to demonstrate the usefulness in such real-world scenarios. The team is looking into whether the methodology can be used to moving sources. "
4,Galwan clash anniversary brings back painful memories; a look at what happened & India's tribute," Last year on this day, while an exhausted country was battling a strange lethal virus and the aftermaths of resulting lockdowns to curb its spread, soldiers of 16 Bihar regiment put up their brave best to face a stand-off with the Chinese troops in the Galwan valley of Ladakh. A video released by the Chinese media in February this year showed hundreds of 'unarmed' uniformed soldiers facing each other with sticks and shields in cold Galwan waters. The 'skirmish' as reported by top media channels witnessed the loss of 20 soldiers of the 16 Bihar Regiment including a Colonel rank officer. Paying homage to Martyrs On Tuesday morning, the Indian Army's Fire and Fury Corps paid a tribute to the soldiers who sacrificed their lives fighting the intrusive Chinese PLA. Major General Akash Kaushik, Chief of Staff, Fire and Fury Corps, laid a wreath at the War Memorial in Leh on the occasion. ""COAS General MM Naravane and all ranks of Indian Army pay homage to the Bravehearts who made supreme sacrifice in Galwan Valley Ladakh while defending the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country. Their valour will be eternally etched in the memory of the Nation,"" the Indian Army spokesperson stated on the microblogging site. In Telangana, Minister for Municipal Administration and Urban Development KT Rama Rao unveiled the statue of Colonel Santosh Babu at the court center in Suryapet. The junction at which the statue has been named after the Galwan clash hero, according to The Print. What happened on June 15, 2020? A Scroll article from last year explained the reason behind the stand-off according to which Chinese troops intruded into Indian territory in the Galwan Valley to block work on a link road branching off from the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi Road. India had to respond. The link road was part of an infrastructure project on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control. China does not want India to improve its infrastructure so that the country remains vulnerable to a 1962-type attack. Chinese troops also encroached upon Indian territory on the northern bank of the Pangong Tso, between ""fingers"" four to eight. They have built bunkers and other fortifications there and refused to dismantle them, claiming that the area belongs to China. Here's the timeline of events that led to the violent clashes between India and China in Galwan Valley in Eastern Ladakh. Following Lieutenant General talks that concluded on June 6 between India and China, symbolic disengagement took place in an attempt to resolve the months-long border standoff in Eastern Ladakh region. After the token disengagement, the Chinese came back again mid-week and erected up a fresh tent, just in 2 days of the disengagement plan agreed between the two Generals. A brawl ensued between the soldiers of the two armies which resulted in the incineration of the Chinese tent. The Chinese troops returned only to come back with a larger platoon of troopers over the weekend. Stone pelting took place between the two sides on Sunday, June 14. Violent clashes broke out on Monday (June 15) evening at the brink with a high gorge towards the Galwan river. According to the sources, skirmishes intensified and many Indian soldiers jumped into the valley in a bid to save themselves. The military confrontation between the Indian and Chinese troopers took place a day before the Major Generals of the sides were going to meet to take the disengagement plan further ahead. As the Chinese refused to back off, an unarmed team of patrol led by Commanding Officer Colonel Babu of the 16 Bihar Regiment set out to discuss with the Chinese counterpart. However, the Chinese held their ground and refused to honour the agreed disengagement plan between the Lt Generals on June 6. The Chinese side deliberately stoked the situation by attacking the unarmed Indian patrol team with boulders, stones, iron rods, clubs wrapped in barbed wire and wooden logs with nails around them. The Indian team retaliated. The Indian military sources confirmed that no firearms were used in the clashes and that most of the injuries sustained were due to the stone-pelting and the use of iron rods by the Chinese side. The CO of the 16 Bihar Regiment sustained serious injuries in the initial attack by the Chinese troopers. He, along with an injured havaldar was immediately rescued and taken back, leaving behind the injured soldiers, who were taken captive by the Chinese side. After a hiatus of 40 minutes, a Major led the same unit to the site and mounted an attack against the Chinese intruders. Things escalated precipitously from that point onwards. The Indian troops attacked the Chinese soldiers with brute power and inflicted serious life-threatening injuries to about 55 Chinese soldiers. The bloody brawl resulted in many casualties on the Chinese side but the sources informed that the exact number of fatalities cannot be determined. The fighting was happening near the ridge and many of the soldiers perished after being pushed down the brink into the fast-moving Galwan river. The Indian unit was massively outnumbered by the Chinese, according to the sources. This is the moment when several casualties on the Indian and Chinese side happened. Sources also inform that there was a brigadier-level Chinese officer on the post waving for peace and asking the two sides to stop the clashes. Fierce fist fighting continued late into the night and stones, metal clubs wrapped in barbed wire were used, resulting in head injuries to many. The clash continued for about 3 hours. Fighting halted well past midnight. Bodies of the soldiers were fished from the river while many injured succumbed to their injuries by morning, sources said. Following the violent clashes between the Indian and Chinese forces, the multiple Colonel-to-Colonel-level talks from both sides happened at the very same post during the day. The Indian Army has now taken over the control of the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) posts. "
5,Pune-based vocalist's music app among Apple Design Award winners," , a studio-quality iOS music app created by Pune-based classical khayal vocalist Sandeep Ranade, has been selected as one of the 12 winners of the 2021 Apple Design Awards.

6,iPhones getting whole lot better with iOS 15; top features coming this fall [details]," Apple has announced iOS 15, a major update with powerful features that will take the iPhone experience to a new level this fall. FaceTime calls will now extend beyond Apple devices, so anyone can join a call from their web browser on Android and Windows devices. The tech giant also introduced 'SharePlay' that will help users focus and be in the moment with new ways to manage notifications and quickly access information. ""iOS 15 helps users stay connected while sharing experiences in real time, gives them new tools to help reduce distraction and find focus, uses intelligence to enhance the photos experience, and, with huge upgrades to Maps, brings new ways to explore the world,"" said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering. iOS 15: Top features With spatial audio, voices in a FaceTime call will sound as if they are coming from where the person is positioned on the screen, and new microphone modes separate the user's voice from background noise. ""Inspired by the stunning portrait photos taken on iPhone, Portrait mode is now available for FaceTime and designed specifically for video calls, so users can blur their background and put themselves in focus,"" Apple announced during its WWDC21 conference on Monday. Users can now share experiences with SharePlay while connecting with friends on FaceTime, including listening to songs together with Apple Music, watching a TV show or movie in sync, or sharing their screen to view apps together. SharePlay works across iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and with shared playback controls, anyone in a SharePlay session can play, pause, or jump ahead. SharePlay has also extended to Apple TV. Focus is another new feature in iOS 15 that filters notifications and apps based on what a user wants to focus on. Customers can set their device to help them be in the moment by creating a custom Focus or selecting a suggested Focus, which uses on-device intelligence to suggest which people and apps are allowed to notify them. Notifications have been redesigned, adding contact photos for people and larger icons for apps that make them even easier to identify. To help reduce distraction, a new notification summary collects non-time-critical notifications for delivery at a more opportune time, such as in the morning and evening. The 'Live Text' uses on-device intelligence to recognise text in a photo and allow users to take action. For example, users can search for and locate the picture of a handwritten family recipe, or capture a phone number from a storefront with the option to place a call. ""Safari gets a new design that makes controls easier to reach with one hand and puts content front and centre. The new tab bar is compact and lightweight, and floats at the bottom of the screen, so users can easily swipe between tabs,"" Apple said. iOS 15 takes Maps even further with brand new ways to navigate and explore. Users will experience significantly enhanced details in cities for neighbourhoods, commercial districts, elevation, and buildings, new road colours and labels, custom-designed landmarks, and a new night-time mode with a moonlit glow. ""With iOS 15, users can simply hold up iPhone, and Maps generates a highly accurate position to deliver detailed walking directions in augmented reality,"" the company said. The developer preview of iOS 15 is available to Apple Developer Programme members now and a public beta will be available to iOS users next month. (With inputs from IANS) "
7,Saliva effective than nasal swabs for detecting COVID-19; new technique to help in mass testing," The mention of COVID-19 testing is likely to evoke imagery of a technician collecting nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) samples. However, the obtaining of samples in this manner, and the post-collection processing are bound by safety and logistical constraints. Saliva, on the other hand, is easier to collect but considered unreliable for diagnostic accuracy. Now, scientists have found that subjecting saliva to a simple processing step before testing can provide results with higher sensitivity compared to conventional NPS samples. According to a new study, a novel protocol that processes saliva in a bead mill homogenizer—a device that vigorously spins test tubes containing samples—before an RT-PCR (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) test can provide results with high accuracy. The method can potentially make large-scale testing for the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection easier and eliminate safety risks posed to health care workers. ""Saliva as a sample type for COVID-19 testing was a game-changer in our fight against the pandemic. It helped us with increased compliance from the population for testing along with decreased exposure risk to the healthcare workers during the collection process,"" said Dr. Ravindra Kolhe, lead investigator of the study, in a statement. Exploring New Testing Protocols RT-PCR is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 testing and continues to remain the most reliable diagnostic technique for detecting the SARS-CoV-2's viral proteins in potential patients. However, in spite of its accuracy, it is bound by several practical limitations, particularly when time is of the essence. These include the need for large laboratory infrastructure, training of professionals, costs, and most importantly, long waiting periods for results. Obtaining the results of an RT-PCR test can take anywhere between 24 to 48 hours. For the study, the authors examined 429 matched sample pairs—NPS and saliva samples—acquired from 344 individuals either in a community setting(a drive-through testing site) or a healthcare setting (a hospital and nursing home). During the first phase of the study using a procedure called protocol U, 240 matched sample pairs were tested for COVID-19 using RT-PCR. In the second phase, using SalivaAll—a clinical validation for sensitive saliva testing—189 matched pairs were analyzed. These samples also included 85 that had already been investigated with protocol U. The saliva samples were processed in an Omni bead mill homogenizer prior to RT-PCR testing during the second phase. Next, the authors conducted an additional study using both protocol U&nbsp;and SalivaAll&nbsp;to ascertain whether bead homogenization played a role in the clinical sensitivity of NPS samples. As a final step, the scientists evaluated a five-sample pooling strategy and generated 20 positive pools from 20 saliva samples previously confirmed to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Each pool contained one positive and four negative samples and was processed with bead homogenizer prior to pooling for COVID-19 RT-PCR testing. They were compared to controls later. Improved Accuracy of Saliva Samples In Phase I of the study, 28.3 percent of samples tested positive for the novel coronavirus either from saliva, NPS, or both. As anticipated, the rate of detection was much lower through saliva samples when compared to NPS (50.0 percent vs. 89.7 percent). However, Phase II of the study&nbsp;yielded contrasting results. 50.2 percent of the samples were found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2&nbsp;either from NPS, saliva, or both. Interestingly, the detection rate in saliva was considerably higher in comparison to NPS (97.8 percent vs. 78.9 percent). Among the 85 samples evaluated with both the protocols, the detection rate was 100 percent for samples tested using SalivaAll. For the samples tested with protocol U, the detection rate was 36.7 percent. According to Dr. Kolhe, the problems surrounding the lower sensitivity of saliva samples to RT-PCR testing may be a result of their gel-like texture. He highlighted the difficulty faced while attempting to transfer samples accurately into extraction plates. Including a step for homogenization provided saliva samples with uniform consistency and viscosity, which made their pipetting easier for testing. The successful demonstration of the five-sample pooling strategy by the researchers also adds credence to the criticality of pool testing in mass surveillance as daily life takes measured steps towards normalcy. ""Monitoring SARS-CoV-2 will remain a public health need. The use of a non-invasive collection method and easily accessible samples such as saliva will enhance screening and surveillance activities and bypass the need for sterile swabs, expensive transport media, and exposure risk, and even the need for skilled healthcare workers for sample collection,"" concluded&nbsp;Dr. Kolhe.&nbsp; "
8,Hospital rush likely even after Covid as one lakh await surgery in KGH Lucknow," A huge backlog of surgeries has built up in the covid pandemic when most hospitals closed down for surgeries except for emergency operations. Now that over one lakh patients in Lucknow's top hospital are in the queue for surgeries once the non-Covid services open up, the country is in for another hospital rush soon. More of these are elective surgeries that are planned in advance and have no emergency requirement. Doctors agree that some surgeries, if postponed beyond a point, could prove fatal for the patient. A senior faculty member at the King George Medical University (KGMU) disclosed, ""There is a backlog of about 45,000 surgeries in KGMU alone. There are surgeries related to gall bladder problems, intestinal issues, tumours, corrective surgeries and even orthopaedic surgeries that had been put on hold due to the Covid pandemic."" According to official estimates, the three major government hospitals- King George's Medical University (KGMU), Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences (RMLIMS) and SPM Civil hospital -- used to conduct an average of 300 surgeries in a day before the second wave of the pandemic set in. Meenu Sharma, 50 has been waiting in the queue since December 2019 for removal of stones in her gall bladder. ""Earlier, there was a long waiting, then a private ward was not available and finally, the pandemic set in. I do not know how long I will have to wait for surgery. I get severe pangs of pain but I have no choice but to bear it,"" she said. Meenu is presently recovering from Covid and does not know if this will further delay her surgery. When the second wave of the pandemic&nbsp;intensified in April, majority of the hospital restricted surgeries, except in emergency cases and accidents. ""Besides having a shortage of staff, there is also the increased risk of infection for the patient in the pandemic,"" said the faculty member. Rescheduling surgeries KGMU Vice Chancellor, Lt Gen Bipin Puri, said: ""We will reschedule surgeries on priority to manage the rush after the second wave subsides and normal functioning starts. Patients with complicated issues will be operated first. We are already working on plans to execute maximum possible surgeries without compromising the efficiency."" S.K. Nanda, Chief Medical Superintendent of Civil hospital, said, ""We have a plan to extend operation timings, post-lockdown, to address the issue of backlog."" RMLIMS spokesperson Srikesh Singh said, ""We are in touch with patients and those whose ailments are in advance stages, will be operated on priority once surgeries begin in full swing.""

9,100 Not Out Campaign: Karnataka Congress leaders held for protesting fuel price hike," Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president D.K. Shivakumar, opposition leader Siddaramaiah and party's state unit leaders courted arrest on Friday for protesting against fuel price hike. ""Police arrested Shivakumar, Siddaramaiah and our party's other leaders when they were staging a protest demo against steep hike in fuel prices near a petrol station in the city,"" said a party official in a statement. As part of its nationwide 5-day protests under ""100 Not Out Campaign"", the party's state leaders, lawmakers and cadres staged demo at about 800 petrol stations in cities and towns across the southern state, holding banners and placards against the central and state governments for the steep hike in fuel prices over the months. ""The BJP-led NDA government raised fuel prices 48 times across the country since January even as citizens were suffering from the burden of inflation. The Centre has collected a whopping Rs 20.6-lakh crore by raising sales tax, excise duty, surcharge and cess on petrol and diesel over the last 7 years,"" asserted the party. Petrol to reach Rs.120 in One Year: Congress Claiming that the opposition party had a duty to educate people against the exploitation by the government, Shivakumar said the rate at which the fuel prices were being increased, petrol would cost Rs 120 per litre in 2022, Rs 160 in 2023 and Rs 200 in 2024. ""Speak out before it's too late,"" tweeted Shivakumar, urging people to join the party in the&nbsp;protest against steel hike in fuel prices.&nbsp;Siddaramaiah,&nbsp;who was the state chief minister from 2013-18, said by raising fuel prices, the government was rubbing salt on the wounded common man, who is already reeling under hardship caused by the Covid pandemic. ""Is this government not ashamed of sucking people's blood? It's acting like leech. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is deceiving people by giving false information,"" thundered Siddaramaiah. The state-run oil marketing firms have cumulatively increased retail price of petrol by Rs 25.72 per litre and diesel by Rs 23.93 per litre over the weeks amid the pandemic's second wave across the country. ""The BJP-led NDA government has increased fuel prices 48 times over the last 5 months, including 10 times in January, 16 times in February and May and 6 times in the first 9 days of this month (June),"" recalled Shivakumar. Members of the party's frontal wings, including Youth Congress, Mahila Congress, Kisan Congress, National Student Union of India (NSUI) and Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) participated in the statewide protest. The party will hold protests at taluk level on Saturday, at hoblis on Sunday, in gram panchayats on Monday and other places on Tuesday. &nbsp;"
10,"More NFTs go under hammer at Sotheby's after $11.8mn ""alien with mask"" digital art [details]"," On Thursday, June 10, NFT of a digital artwork called a 'CryptoPunk' sold for $11.8 million during Sotheby's online auction - Natively Digital: A Curated NFT Sale. It was purchased by Shalom Meckenzie, the largest shareholder of digital sports company DraftKings and the online event on a whole fetched the renowned art and luxury space, a total of $17.1 million across works by 27 digital artists. Today,&nbsp;team DraftKings was spotted at Nasdaq opening to ring the bell in their CryptoPunk t-shirts that flaunted the now-famous $11.8 million worth digital artwork of an alien wearing a mask. As reported by Reuters, ""Although the sale was on an online auction, the works were displayed on screens in Sotheby's exhibitions in New York, London and Hong Kong. The art-house also opened its first-ever virtual gallery: a replica of its real-world building on New Bond Street in London, in the online virtual world Decentraland."" CryptoPunks are a set of 10,000 pixel-art characters made by Larva Labs in 2017. The one sold by Sotheby's here is an alien with blue-green skin, wearing a medical mask. The work is in the form of an NFT, meaning it is authenticated by blockchain, which certifies its originality and ownership. The NFT is sent to the buyer's cryptocurrency wallet; no physical artwork changes hands, said the Reuters report further. What is NFT? Acronym for non-fungible token, NFT is basically data that is stored or accounted for in a digital ledger, and that data represents something specific. An NFT can, for example, represent a piece of art, a music album or other types of digital files, explains a Forbes report. And when one buys an NFT, one is essentially paying up for a digital recording of ownership of a token, which can then be transferred to a digital wallet. In the inexplicable new-age digital world of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoins, NFT seems like another new addition, only it isn't. ""The history of non-fungibles is much longer than most people realize. The first attempts at NFTs were in the 2012–2013 Colored Coin era,"" explains Andrew Steinwold on Medium. The announcement by Sotheby's on its Twitter handle led to an online face-off of sorts where art appreciators began to question the skills required in creating a pixelated digital art piece.&nbsp; Although the Cryptopunk community of digital artists is small but growing, the current record-high auction has lifted the spirits of many who struggle to find buyers for their NFTs.&nbsp; Claire Silver whose CryptoPunk artwork was outside the Museum of Modern Art in New York last month wrote, ""So excited to see this art movement getting the recognition it deserves. Well done!"" "

13,Sharks in Marine Protected Area in the Indian Ocean entice illegal fishermen," More than 14,000 sharks were caught in the Marine Protected Area (MPA) in the Indian Ocean between 2010 and 2016, while interviews with local fishermen indicate that the true number was ""considerably higher"" than that, said a new study of the enforment data. The MPA was established in 2010 around the Chagos Archipelago, commonly known as British Indian Ocean Territory (BIOT), and prohibits any fishing inside its boundaries. The current study looked at data on illicit fishing in the MPA, which covers a large area (640,000 km2/250,000 mi2) and has both pristine and distant reefs. From 2010 to 2016, 126 of the 188 vessels investigated by the BIOT MPA patrol boat were suspected of unlawful fishing, with 97% of these allegedly targeting sharks. The University of Exeter, the Zoological Society of London, Oceanswell, and MRAG conducted the research. ""Enforcement of MPA rules in a large, remote area such as this is extremely difficult,"" said lead author Claire Collins. ""Our findings highlight the threat of illegal fishing to sharks in the BIOT MPA, which is home to critically endangered species such as the oceanic whitetip and scalloped hammerhead. Fishers often target reef areas, where many of the sharks are juveniles, and taking sharks at this life stage could be especially damaging to species numbers"". Collins adds, ""However, it's important to note that - despite evidence of shark fishing - the MPA still provides a vital refuge in the Indian Ocean, and shark numbers there are still much higher than most other places"". According to the study, fishermen told the researchers that vessels frequently fished in the MPA without being noticed, offering ""clear evidence that total extraction was considerably higher"" than the estimate of 14,340 based on observed vessels. ""It is crucial to work with fishing communities to understand where, when and why people fish illegally - and how we can improve deterrence,"" Tom B Letessier, the final author, stated. ""For example, we found fishers had very different ideas of the fines they could face, and some felt there were very unlikely to be caught - so improving awareness of the sanctions, in addition to increasing the probability of being caught, could be beneficial."" Efforts are being made to strengthen MPA enforcement, including increasing the use of satellite tracking of vessels and ensuring implementation is responsive to the danger of illegal fishing. This study emphasizes the importance of connecting with fishermen&nbsp;to learn about the challenges they face and what drives their actions. "
14,"Black holes have an unexpected effect beyond their own galaxies, reveals study"," There is a black hole at the center of practically every suitably massive galaxy, and its gravitational field. While known for being extraordinarily intense, they only impacted a tiny region surrounding the galaxy's center. Even though these objects are millions of times smaller than their host galaxies, it was believed that the Universe can only be understood if the evolution of galaxies is regulated by the activity of these black holes, because the observed properties of the galaxies cannot be explained without them. According to theoretical expectations, as these black holes increase in size, they generate enough energy to heat up and force out the gas within galaxies&nbsp;to tremendous distances. Observing and characterizing the mechanism by which this energy interacts with galaxies and changes their evolution is interesting.&nbsp; A study led by Ignacio Martn Navarro, a researcher at the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC), went a step further and attempted to determine whether the matter and energy emitted from around these black holes can affect the evolution of not only the host galaxy, but also the satellite galaxies around it, at even greater distances. To accomplish this, the researchers employed the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which allowed them to examine the features of galaxies in thousands of clusters. ""Surprisingly we found that the satellite galaxies formed more or fewer stars depending on their orientation with respect to the central galaxy"", says Annalisa Pillepich, co-author of the paper and researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy (MPIA, Germany). To try to explain this geometrical effect on the features of the satellite galaxies, the researchers employed Illustris-TNG, a cosmological simulation of the Universe&nbsp;whose code includes a unique approach of dealing with the interaction between central black holes and their host galaxies. ""Just as with the observations, the Illustris-TNG simulation shows a clear modulation of the star formation rate in satellite galaxies depending on their position with respect to the central galaxy"", adds Pillepich. This finding is significant because it provides empirical evidence for the assumption that core black holes play a major role in regulating the evolution of galaxies, which is a fundamental component of our present view of the Universe. Nonetheless, given the difficulties of measuring the possible effect of black holes in real galaxies rather than examining solely theoretical implications, this concept is constantly questioned. These findings imply that there is a specific link between black holes and host galaxies, allowing them to expel matter to enormous distances from galactic centers and even influence the evolution of other neighboring galaxies.

15,Apple doubles down on privacy; gives users more control on data [see how]," After introducing the App Tracking Transparency and privacy nutrition labels on the App Store, Apple has expanded its privacy-focused approach to another level with new protections in iOS 15, iPadOS 15, macOS Monterey, and watchOS 8, which help users better control and manage access to their data. In the Mail app, the new 'Mail Privacy Protection' stops senders from using invisible pixels to collect information about the user. The new feature helps users prevent senders from knowing when they open an email, and masks their IP address so it can't be linked to other online activity or used to determine their location, the company said during its flagship WWDC21 developer conference late on Monday. Apple focuses on privacy, as always ""Privacy has been central to our work at Apple from the very beginning,"" said Craig Federighi, Apple's senior vice president of Software Engineering. ""Every year, we push ourselves to develop new technology to help users take more control of their data and make informed decisions about whom they share it with. This year's updates include innovative features that give users deeper insights and more granular control than ever before,"" he told a virtual audience. Apple&nbsp;said that the 'Intelligent Tracking Prevention' tool in Safari browser is getting stronger by also hiding the user's IP address from trackers. ""This means they can't utilise the user's IP address as a unique identifier to connect their activity across websites and build a profile about them,"" the company noted. Apple&nbsp;also announced that it will launch an App Privacy Report that will be live in settings. App Privacy Report will arrive as part of a software update to iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and watchOS 8. With App Privacy Report, users can see how often each app has used the permission they've previously granted to access their location, photos, camera, microphone, and contacts during the past seven days. Users can check whether this makes sense to them, and take action by going to the app in Settings if it doesn't. Users can also find out with whom their data may be shared by seeing all the third-party domains an app is contacting. ""With on-device speech recognition, the audio of users' requests is processed right on their iPhone or iPad by default. This addresses one of the biggest privacy concerns for voice assistants, which is unwanted audio recording,"" the company further announced. For iCloud+ users, the company announced new premium features, including iCloud Private Relay, Hide My Email, and expanded HomeKit Secure Video support, at no additional cost. Private Relay is a new internet privacy service that's built right into iCloud, allowing users to connect to and browse the web in a more secure and private way. When browsing with Safari, Private Relay ensures all traffic leaving a user's device is encrypted, so no one between the user and the website they are visiting can access and read it, not even Apple or the user's network provider. All the user's requests are then sent through two separate internet relays, said Apple. The company also introduced additional privacy features for users and developers. With share current location, users can easily share their current location with an app just once, without giving the developer further access after that session. Developers can customise the share current location button, and integrate it directly into their apps. ""With enhanced Photos limited library access, developers can offer smart functionality -- like a recent photos folder for specific albums -- even when a user has only granted limited access,"" Apple&nbsp;said.

16,"Kochi woman forced to drink urine, brutally thrashed by partner for weeks [shocking details]"," It was recently reported that there's an increase in domestic violence cases ever since the COVID lockdowns came into effect in 2020. But a spine-chilling incident has come to the fore, wherein a Kochi woman endured brutal torture at the hands of her own partner for several days. After over 20 days, the 27-year-old woman gathered courage and managed to escape after her partner had threatened to kill her. But what went on while she was held captive is beyond comprehension. The woman, a resident of Kannur, had been in a live-in relationship with 33-year-old Martin Joseph, a share trader, since last year's lockdown. But the continues assault and violence forced her to go back to her home. But Joseph blackmailed the woman and threatened to leak her nude videos if she didn't return. Fearing the worse, the woman came back, but she was tortured, beaten back and blue, robbed, and even forced to drink urine. ""He used to tie me to the bed and hit me with a mop, broom and belt. He used to continuously beat me in the same areas. He has made me drink his urine and water from the toilet, used to pour hot water on top of my bruises and to stop me from sleeping, he used to put chilly powder mixed water in my eyes,"" the woman recounted her horrors to Mathrubhumi. Woman escapes fearing for life When she was threatened to be killed, the victim of extreme torture&nbsp;managed to escape. At that point, she didn't care if the videos were leaked to her family, she just had to save her life. She escaped the apartment with a knife in her hand and went straight to the police station. Fearing she was followed by Joseph, she did not file a complaint then, but came back a month later after gathering courage. In the FIR, which was registered by Kochi Police on April 8, the woman said she was confined by Martin from February 15 till March 8, during which he tortured&nbsp;her and even took Rs 5 lakh from her. Based on her statement, the police have registered a case against Joseph under various sections of IPC, including 323 (Punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 324 (Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 344 (Wrongful confinement for ten or more days), 376(Punishment for rape), 420 (Cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 506 (Punishment for criminal intimidation), TNM reported after accessing a copy of the FIR. One month later, no arrest yet Shockingly, the spine-chilling incident did not speed up the police's efforts to find Joseph. However, when the woman revealed the photos of her grievous injuries on the back, and the incident garnered public attention, the police is acting on it. ""We will investigate and arrest the person very soon,"" Kochi Police Commissioner Nagaraju CH told TNM, adding that a special team has been set up to nab the accused. "
17,"Slept for 24,000 years, and this living could still eat and reproduce [details]"," A team of scientists from Russia has revived a tiny worm-like&nbsp;organism&nbsp;called a Bdelloid rotifer. The tiny living being was found&nbsp;in 24,000-year-old Siberian ice. Surprisingly, after thawing, the worm was able to eat and reproduce. The new discovery could shed vital clues&nbsp;into how to freeze multi-cellular tissues like organs, and it will help medical experts to bring revolutionary changes in the healthcare sector as humans move forward.&nbsp; The future of&nbsp;cryptobiosis ""Our report is the hardest proof as of today that multicellular animals could withstand tens of thousands of years in cryptobiosis, the state of almost completely arrested metabolism,"" said&nbsp;Stas Malavin, a researcher at the&nbsp;Institute of Physicochemical and Biological Problems in Soil Science in Russia, in a recent statement.&nbsp; In the study report published in the journal Current Biology, Malavin who is the co-author of the study called the survival of&nbsp;Bdelloid rotifer ''an incredible feat.''&nbsp; ""The takeaway is that a multicellular organism can be frozen and stored as such for thousands of years and then return back to life -- a dream of many fiction writers.&nbsp;Of course, the more complex the organism, the trickier it is to preserve it.&nbsp;For mammals, it's not currently possible,"" added Malavin.&nbsp; Bdelloid rotifer: All you need to know Bdelloid rotifers are widely considered the toughest living beings in the world, and they are known for their resistance to survive even in extreme environments. According to experts,&nbsp;Bdelloid rotifer could even withstand intense radiation, and can easily endure dehydration and low oxygen levels.&nbsp; ""If true, this would be an incredible result and extend the recorded ability of Bdelloid rotifers to survive freezing from 10 years to 30,000 years,""&nbsp;Timothy Barraclough, a Professor of Evolutionary Biology told Insider.&nbsp; However, Barraclough made it clear that the multicellular organism might have colonized the ice&nbsp;later than 24,000 years ago, or after the ice core was removed from the ground.&nbsp; "

She had a secret crush on the actor who played Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter saga.&nbsp; Years later during an interaction with Entertainment Tonight, Tom Felton finally opened up about his connection with the Little Women actress. ""We are something if that makes any sense. We've been very close for a long time. I adore her. I think she's fantastic. Hopefully, she returns the compliment,"" Felton said while gushing about her.&nbsp; A&nbsp;Slytherin-Gryffindor thing While talking about the romantic side, the Harry Potter actor added, ""As far as the romantic side of it, I think that's a Slytherin/Gryffindor thing rather than a Tom and Emma thing. I absolutely think the world of her. I think to be a part of what we've all been a part of, but for her to be the only girl, certainly the youngest one on set, to grow up with what she had to grow up with was incredibly exciting. You're going to get me teary now, but no, I think she's a fantastic influence on the world."" The actor added that he still keeps in touch with&nbsp;Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and talk about regular activities on how their dog wouldn't eat the food, or the kitchen sink is plugged.&nbsp; Tom Felton had originally played the trio's (Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley) enemy in the seven films of Harry Potter, however, it seems in his offscreen life, he had shared a warm friendship with all the cast members.&nbsp; "
19,Vijaylakshmi on Facing Online Harassment over Break Up with Srujan Lokesh: I Didn't Cheat on Him," Vijayalakshmi is once again in the news. The multilingual actress, who has been pleading for help from the film industry after her sister fell ill, has come up with another video where she has mentioned about her broken relationship with actor-TV host Srujan Lokesh. Her sister Usha Devi has not been keeping well and Vijayalakshmi is seeking financial assistance from her estranged husband Raja Babu, who happens to be the sibling of veteran actress-politician Jaya Prada. In the latest video, Vijayalakshmi has made allegations against Raja Babu and Jayaprada for failing to lend a helping hand to her. She had accused Usha Devi's husband of not giving her divorce nor providing financial help even during their difficult times. Usha and Raj Babu tied the knot in 1999 and she gave birth to a baby boy in 2000. Vijayalakshmi Mentions About Srujan In the video, Vijayalakshmi claims about getting harassed by netizens on social media sites and facing allegations of destroying Srujan Lokesh's life. ""I didn't cheat on him. If I wanted to play with his life, I would not have taken our relationship to the extent of engagement. There is a different story altogether which nobody would like to report,"" she said, stating people treat her like a villain in every issue. Vijayalakshmi was earlier engaged to Srujan Lokesh, but their relationship ended before they tied the knot. Vijayalakshmi's life in recent years has met with lots of controversies. Last year, the Nagamandala actress had released a series of videos requesting Kannada and Tamil film fraternity to help her financial issues as she was having health issues and not getting work. The KFCC, Kiccha Sudeep, and a few others had extended helping hand to her. Rajinikanth&nbsp;gave her financial assistance when she was struggling to bear the hospital expenses. Vijayalakshmi and Seeman's Controversy These episodes apart, Vijayalakshmi&nbsp;had accused Tamil filmmaker-politician Seeman of cheating her. She had also attempted to kill herself. ""I tried my level best to survive all these days because of my mother and sister, but I have been humiliated in the media by Harinadar recently. I have already taken a couple of my BP tablets, so in some time I will suffer from low blood pressure and in a few hours I will be dead,"" she said in a Facebook video. "

22,The Family Man Season 2 review: Manoj Bajpayee and Samantha Akkineni save the sinking ship," The wait is finally over, and the much-anticipated second season of The Family Man has been released on Amazon Prime on June 04. Amid all the pre-release hype and expectations, The Family Man season 2 has ended up as an average fare for the audiences, and it lacked that extra thrill and emotional attachment offered by the first season. However, this second season featuring Manoj Bajpayee, Samantha Akkineni, and Priyamani in the lead roles is rich in grandeur, and creators Raj Nidimoru and Krishna DK tried to showcase global and domestic conflicts using a humanist lens.&nbsp; The Family Man season 2 could have been much crispier The second season began in a very interesting manner, where we can see a group of Tamil freedom fighters/terrorists escape to India via sea. One of them named Subbu (Srikrishna Dayal) reaches Tamil Nadu, while his brother escapes to London. The episode soon shifts to the life of Srikant Tiwari (Manoj Bajpayee) who is fed up with his seemingly meticulous team leader. Even though he is leading an ordinary life, his mind is still with&nbsp;Threat Analysis and Surveillance Cell (TASC), and he can be seen recollecting the happenings in the first season out of trauma with a cigarette in his lips.&nbsp; His relationship with Suchithra Iyer Tiwari (Priyamani) is not that healthy, and both of them can be seen visiting a counselor. However, the counselor asks them questions about their physical relationship and it irks Srikanth. However, an adamant Suchithra who wanted her husband to be an ''okay man'' promises the counselor that she will bring him again to the session.&nbsp; Things take an unexpected turn when a Tamil Nadu minister visits Subbu and leaks his whereabouts to TASC members in Tamil Nadu. Upon instruction from the central government, TASC members in association with JK Talpade (Sharib Hashmi) tries to nab Subbu. But Subbu resists and he keeps a couple as hostages in a smalltime hotel. At this moment, Srikant's timely intervention helps TASC to arrest Subbu. In the meantime, we can see Raji (Samantha Akkineni) who is working in a thread mill in Tamil Nadu. In the initial moments, Samantha is portrayed as a weak woman who does not have the courage to reach against the sexual harassment she faces in her daily life. However, things take an unexpected (expected) turn when the audience comes to know that Raji is a freedom fighter/terrorist. From then, the series begins in full swing, where audiences can see locations shifting from India to London, and London to India continuously.&nbsp; The un-necessities in The Family Man Season 2 The Family Man Season 2 could have been an impeccable series if the editor has paid a little more attention to his work. All the characters in this series have unnecessary backstories, and it will test the patience of the audience for sure. Whenever the series gains momentum, the creators spoil it by adding melodramatic backstories. Even the boyfriend had an unnecessary backstory, and it was totally unnecessary for a thriller drama.&nbsp; Samantha Akkineni's stellar performance The saving grace of The Family Man 2&nbsp;is the stellar performance from Samantha Akkineni. As a cold-blooded assassin/freedom fighter, Samantha excelled, and the actress reinvented herself as a powerful performer. For Manoj Bajpayee, the character of Srikant Tiwari was just a cakewalk. The supporting star cast includes Priyamani, Sharib Hashmi, and Darshan Kumar all did justice to their respective roles.&nbsp; Final Verdict: The Family Man Season 2 is not as elegant and classy as the first season. However, the second season can be watched to witness the stellar performance of Samantha Akkineni and Manoj Bajpayee.&nbsp; "

The trailer has already gone viral on the internet, and audiences are praising director Karthik Subbaraj for crafting such a dark-themed clip with international standards. Starring Dhanush, Joju George, and Aishwarya Lekshmi in the lead roles, the trailer indicates that the film will be a high-voltage gangster flick with lots of action sequences and gunfight scenes.&nbsp; Dhanush and Joju George steal the show The two minutes and the twenty-three-second trailer begins on an interesting note where the director shows a detention center. Later, the camera shifts to a scene where a group of shooters is all set to execute a group of people. Dhanush makes his grand entry at the 25th second of the trailer. With a Singham mustache, Dhanush can be seen running wildly with fire in his hand.&nbsp; The trailer indicates that Aishwarya Lekshmi is doing the role of a singer in&nbsp;Jagame Thandhiram. In the 42nd second of the trailer, Joju George makes his stylish entry, and he can be seen walking with full swag after throwing a cigarette. The remaining part of the trailer is filled with shooting scenes, blood, and gore.&nbsp; Jagame Thandhiram: A movie made with international standards The trailer of the movie literally resembles an international gangster flick. With impeccable color grading, often seen in Hollywood movies, director Karthik Subbaraj&nbsp;has apparently made this film with international standards.&nbsp; Dhanush&nbsp;will be seen in two different makeovers in&nbsp;Jagame Thandhiram. Joju George is playing the role of a deadly gangster based in London, while Aishwarya Lekshmi will be seen enacting the character of Dhanush's love interest.&nbsp; Santhosh Narayanan has composed the music of&nbsp;Jagame Thandhiram.&nbsp;Shreyaas Krishna has handled the cinematography, while Vivek Harshan has carried out the editing for this film.&nbsp; Jagame Thandhiram will be streamed exclusively on Netflix on June 18, 2021.&nbsp; "
24,"Movie Review: Huma Qureshi's Hollywood debut ""Army Of The Dead: Ocean's Eleven"" gets a zombie remix"," Movie Review: Army Of The Dead; Cast: Dave Bautista, Ella Purnell, Omari Hardwick, Ana de la Reguera, Theo Rossi, Matthias Schweighofer, Nora Arnezeder, Hiroyuki Sanada, Tig Notaro, Raul Castillo, Samantha Win; Huma Qureshi; Direction: Zack Snyder; Rating: * * and 1/2 (two and a half stars) ""Ocean's Eleven"" gets a zombie remix in Zack Snyder's latest, as Dave Bautista and company infiltrate undead-infested Las Vegas Strip to try and walk away with a fat load of cash against all odds. The idea manages to stay afloat because the film does not take itself too seriously. Despite the film's slant at graphic gore, Snyder keeps it irreverent and that is a respite. He crafts a circus of excesses, suitably violent and partly scary. The film ends up more like a tribute to classic zombie horror than an attempt to reinvent the template in any way. It's almost as if Snyder was out having fun with the genre that started his career as a filmmaker way back in 2004, when he made his directorial debut with a remake of ""Dawn Of The Dead"", George A. Romero's 1978 release that continues to have a cult following globally. Before anything, from the Indian perspective, considerable hype had been built around the fact that ""Army Of The Dead"" marks Bollywood actress Huma Qureshi's Hollywood foray. Playing a single mother named Geeta, Huma gets restricted footage. She is okay in a role whose ethnicity seems to have been decided keeping in mind that it could widen curiosity about the film in the Indian market. An interesting aside here: Riding on Hollywood's newfound love for inclusivity and in keeping with a trend followed by most films aimed at a global mass market, ""Army Of The Dead"" brims with international ethnicity. Huma apart, cast members bear origin in Mexico (Ana de la Reguera), Japan (Hiroyuki Sanada), France (Nora Arnezeder), Germany (Matthias Schweighofer), England (Ella Purnell) and Canada (Samantha Win), besides of course the fact that hero Dave Bautista owes descent to a Greek mother and Filipino father. Global cast trending It is important to understand such a casting. It becomes an advantage, building instant connect in markets all across the world for a film that goes easy on script originality. Snyder and his co-screenwriters (Shay Hatten and Joby Harold) imagine a derelict Las Vegas, walled from the rest of the world after a zombie outbreak. A casino boss named Tanaka (Sanada) approaches former zombie war hero Scott Ward (Bautista) with a job. Ward must venture into zombie-infested Las and quarantined Vegas Strip to retrieve $200 million from a vault. He has 32 hours before the government nukes the city. For Ward, the money he gets could be his ticket to reunite with his estranged daughter Kate (Purnell), so he accepts the job. As he hastily assembles his team and they get going, the plot becomes predictable, though Snyder manages to hold interest with smart storytelling. For a zombie film&nbsp;""Army Of The Dead""&nbsp;could seem a bit long at 148 minutes, though Snyder scores because he keeps the shocks and spins coming in, liberally laced with cheeky humour and stylishly rendered zombie violence. Hardcore genre buffs normally don't ask for more. "
25,"US Covid-19 deaths cross 600,000, full vaccination at 40% so far"," Six hundred thousand. Americas coronavirus death toll topped the 600,000 mark Tuesday, even as an aggressive nationwide vaccination drive has crushed daily caseloads and pulled the country back to a place where it can look forward to summer as usual and even Independence Day celebrations in pre-pandemic style. Hundreds continue to die each day. President Joe Biden is warning that the fight isn't over and is urging more Americans to get vaccinated as contagious variants spread. It's been 16 months since the first known deaths from the virus in the US. Within four months starting early March last year, 100,000 perished. Fall and winter were brutal, taking the toll to 400,000 before Biden took charge as president. The last 200,000 deaths have come at a much slower pace, riding on strong vaccination numbers. By now, more than 50 per cent of Americans have got at least one shot of the Covid-19 vaccine and over 40 per cent are fully vaccinated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Crowds are surging at tourist hotspots, businesses are reopening with a burst of confidence, the malls are packed, people are shaking hands again. Restrictions being eased States like California and New York which bore the worst brunt of the initial outbreak are lifting most restrictions this week, and some of them are marking the moment with fireworks. Biden&nbsp;was hoping to get at least 70 per cent of the population partially vaccinated by July 4 and the current numbers are just short of 65 percent. The US is currently delivering 1 million jabs per day, dropping off the highs and the urgency of 3 million plus vaccines per day in early Spring. In New York, 70 per cent of adults in the state have received at least one shot. ""What does 70 per cent mean? It means that we can now return to life as we know it,"" Governor Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. The White House is planning a big bang July Fourth celebration to mark a standout moment in the country's recovery, even as other nations continue to struggle with lockdowns and resurgent variants of the virus. Biden plans to celebrate the July Fourth holiday as America's ""summer of freedom"" and highlight his government's ""wartime response"" to the&nbsp;vaccination challenge when he took office. "
